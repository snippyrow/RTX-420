# RTX-421

These are the documents for the new version, the RTX-421. The previous documentation was in conflict, so I re-wrote them here.
These documents are the final cut, and are to be followed.

# General

The RTX-421 is a homebrew video card with hardware-accelerated sprites and drawing. It is primarily used to display text, but also hosts support for graphical modes.
It is also used as an extension of a 6502 or a 65816-based computer, used for fast graphics. The primary embeded-cpu, a W65C02S, can run at a stable 10mhz, or up to 20mhz.

Here is the full features' list:
